#Normally Slim framework works when index.php includes in the url which makes url not well-formed. So using the .htacess rules we can get rid of index.php from the url and make some friendly urls. Inside v1 folder create a file named .htaccess and paste the following code. (Note that this file name shouldnâ€™t include any additional extension in the name like .txt)

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{ENV:BASE}index.php [QSA,L]
